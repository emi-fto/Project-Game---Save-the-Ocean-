## Description

Save the Ocean is a game created to make people aware on the topic of ocean pollution, and by playing to understand the impact of their actions in the real life. The game starts with a player (You), a small net and plastic bottles, falling down to the ocean. They need to be catched with the small net before they touch the ocean itself. The more bottles you pick, the more the score goes up. If the bottles touch the ocean, you lose a life. The player has 3 lives and the game ends when they reach 0. Only if the player has catched at least 20 bottles, will see a clean ocean, otherwise he's asked to try again.

## Main Functionalities

- The small net moves by pushing left, right, up and down arrows.
- Bottles appear at the top of the screen from random locations.
- The game difficulty increases as the game progresses. This changes the speed of the bottles falling.
- The score is calculated based on the bottles catched. Each bottle + 1 point
- The player has 3 starting lives, every time bottle touches the ocean, he loses a life.
- The game has two possible ends: 1-The player catches at least 20 bottles and will see a clean ocean. 2-The player catches less than 20 bottles and will still see a polluted ocean.
